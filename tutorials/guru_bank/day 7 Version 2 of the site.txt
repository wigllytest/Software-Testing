Hey QA Ninja,


Developers claim to fix all bugs you reported in version 1 and have added the Balance enquiry module to version 2.



Go ahead and re-run your failed test cases.



Link to version 2 of the site

Use the login credentials you have already generated for version 1.



Also, check the balance enquiry module for the first time!



See you tomorrow!

Happy Testing
